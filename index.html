# THE ELITE #1 RECRUITING SYSTEM - 2025 LATEST
## The Top 1% Strategy That Gets College Coaches to Message & Call Back
### Using Latest NCAA Rules, Transfer Portal Impact, and Expert Coach Psychology

---

## ⚠️ CRITICAL 2025 CONTEXT: WHAT'S CHANGED

**Everything you need to know about recruiting in November 2025:**

### **#1: NEW NCAA SCHOLARSHIP RULES (Effective 2025-26 Season)**

**What changed:**
- All 28 rostered players can now receive athletic aid (before: only 11.7-11.9 scholarships)[2]
- Hard roster cap: 28 players (D1 soccer)
- This means MORE opportunities for athletes to receive scholarships
- BUT fewer total roster spots available

**What this means for YOU:**
- Schools have LIMITED roster spots (28 max)
- They're MORE selective, not less
- Being "targeted" (on their recruiting list) is harder to achieve
- Standing out among the 25-30 targeted recruits per school is CRITICAL
- Your outreach strategy matters MORE than ever[2][175]

---

### **#2: TRANSFER PORTAL CHANGING EVERYTHING (2025 Reality)**

**Current state:**
- 4,060+ Division I athletes in transfer portal as of June 2025[188]
- 418% increase since 2020[188]
- Coaches are now filling rosters with portal transfers BEFORE recruiting high school players[180]

**What coaches do NOW:**
1. Keep current stars with NIL money (not available to you yet)
2. Shop the portal for proven starters (not applicable to you)
3. Fill remaining spots with high school recruits[180]

**What this means for YOU:**
- Roster spots for high school recruits have DECREASED
- Competition is FIERCER
- Coaches need PROOF you can contribute immediately (not "potential")
- Your approach must be DIFFERENT than before
- Early contact and multi-channel outreach is NO LONGER OPTIONAL[176][180]

---

### **#3: WHAT COACHES ACTUALLY LOOK FOR (2025 Data)**

**Research shows coaches evaluate in this order:**

**1. COACHABILITY (30-35% weight):**
- Do you take feedback without attitude?
- Can you adjust quickly?
- Do you stay focused during tough sessions?
- Will you be a "no-babysitting" player?[181][184]

**Red flags coaches look for:**
- ❌ Poor attitude when substituted
- ❌ Head down after mistakes
- ❌ Body language issues (hands on hips, eye-rolling)
- ❌ Drama or off-field concerns[184]

**Green flags coaches look for:**
- ✅ Energy when not on ball
- ✅ Supporting teammates after their mistakes
- ✅ Taking feedback immediately
- ✅ Positive body language[181][184]

**2. WORK ETHIC & MENTALITY (25-30% weight):**
- Do you work when tired?
- Do you defend as hard as you attack?
- Do you show up early, stay late?
- Will you "raise the standard"?[181][184]

**3. VERSATILITY (15-20% weight):**
- Can you play multiple positions?
- Can you adapt to their system quickly?
- Do you solve multiple roster problems?[184]

**4. RAW SKILL/ATHLETICISM (15-20% weight):**
- Yes, skill matters
- BUT it's last, not first
- Two players with equal skill: the one with better attitude/work ethic wins[181][184][187]

**Coaches also check:**
- Your academics (teachers will be called)
- Your discipline record
- Your character (custodians will be asked about you)
- Your social media (it WILL be reviewed)[184]

---

### **#4: HOW COACHES ACTUALLY RECRUIT HIGH SCHOOL PLAYERS NOW (2025)**

**The 3-stage filter coaches use:**

**Stage 1: Identify (500+ athletes evaluated)**
- Look at video/stats on SportsRecruits, Hudl, etc.
- Evaluate at tournaments, camps, showcases
- Get recommendations from club/high school coaches
- Result: Narrow to 100-200 "possibilities"

**Stage 2: Target (30-50 athletes targeted)**
- Build deeper profile (academics, character, coachability)
- Begin evaluation of fit + system match
- Monitor social media and character[178]
- Result: Narrow to 30-50 "target list"

**Stage 3: Offer (10-15 offers extended)**
- Decide which to offer scholarships to
- Make recruiting push with top tier
- Result: Narrow to 10-15 actual offers[178]

**WHERE YOUR OUTREACH MATTERS:**
- Stage 1→Stage 2: You need to get on their TARGET list (not just their radar)
- This is where multi-channel outreach breaks through
- Most players never make it to Stage 2
- Your specific, researched, persistent outreach = different signal than random athlete[176]

---

---

## **THE #1 ELITE RECRUITING SYSTEM: 3 EXPERT ACTION STEPS**

### **Why this system works for top 1% of recruits:**

✅ **Targeted schools only** → 35-45% response vs 2-3% random outreach[92]
✅ **Gets you on TARGET LIST** (Stage 2, not Stage 1 noise)[176]
✅ **Multi-channel approach** → 287% higher engagement[167][170]
✅ **Assistant coach focus** → 40-50% response vs 10% head coach[44]
✅ **Psychology-based messaging** → 35-45% response vs 2-3% generic[129][130]
✅ **Perfect tournament timing** → Coaches actively recruiting[44]
✅ **Shows coachability** → Your outreach shows initiative (which coaches love)[177]
✅ **Early execution** → Gets you on radar before competition[177]

---

## **EXPERT ACTION STEP #1: RESEARCH & TARGET (MONDAY - 2 HOURS)**

### **Why this step is CRITICAL:**

In 2025, coaches are being MORE selective, not less. Random outreach = 2-3% response. Targeted roster needs outreach = 35-45% response[92]. With fewer roster spots (transfer portal effect), being on their TARGET LIST matters more than ever.[176]

---

### **Step 1A: Build Target List Using SportsRecruits Roster Needs (30 minutes)**

**Go to:** sportsrecruits.com

**Tutorial:** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1I5fg8KffA (0:46-2:00)

**Exact process:**
1. Log in to SportsRecruits
2. Click 9-square menu → "Schools"
3. Click "Filter" button
4. Click "Roster Needs"
   - Graduation year: ☐ 2026  ☐ 2027  ☐ 2028
   - Position: ☐ MID  ☐ FWD  ☐ DEF  ☐ GK
   - Click "Apply"
5. Add second filter: Division (D1, D2, D3, NAIA)
6. Add third filter: Academic interests/majors
7. Click "Apply"

**Result:** 20-50 schools ACTIVELY recruiting your position

**Why this works:** These schools published "we need this position in this grad year" - you're contacting them at the exact moment they need someone like you[92][176]

---

### **Step 1B: Research Each School's Coaching Staff (45 minutes)**

**For each of your 25-30 target schools, find:**

✅ Head Coach name
✅ **Assistant Coach names** (this is KEY - assistants handle recruiting)
✅ One specific recent achievement (recent win, conference ranking, player signing)
✅ Their tactical style/formation
✅ A player from your area/club who went there
✅ Instagram handle
✅ Twitter/X handle
✅ Email address (format: firstname.lastname@school.edu usually)
✅ Any phone number available

**Where to find assistant coaches:**
1. School athletics website → Coaching Staff page
2. Write down ALL assistant coaches' names
3. School's staff directory (usually on main athletic dept site)
4. Find email format

**Pro tip - WHY assistant coaches matter:**
- Head coaches: 100+ DMs per week (many ignored)
- Assistant coaches: 20-30 DMs per week (actually read)
- Assistant coaches: Handle day-to-day recruiting
- Response rate: Assistant coaches = 40-50%, Head coach = 10-15%[44]

---

### **Step 1C: Create Your Research Document (30 minutes)**

**Make a Google Sheet with columns:**

| School | Head Coach | Asst Coach 1 | Asst Coach 2 | Email | Instagram | Recent Achievement | Formation/Style | Pipeline Strength |
|--------|-----------|--------------|--------------|-------|-----------|-------------------|-----------------|------------------|
| Arizona St | Coach A | Coach B | Coach C | email@asu.edu | @asumsoccer | Won Pac-12 Week 6 | 4-3-3 press | Strong (has player from your club) |

**Key: Pipeline Strength Rating**
- Rate 1-5: How likely are they to recruit from YOUR area/club?[176]
- 5 = They recruit YOUR specific region heavily
- 1 = They rarely recruit your area

Focus on 5-4 rated schools FIRST (easier to get response)[176]

---

## **EXPERT ACTION STEP #2: CREATE PROFESSIONAL ASSETS (TUESDAY - 3 HOURS)**

### **Why this step is CRITICAL:**

70% of coaches make recruiting decisions based on first visual impression. Coaches evaluate 4 things: Skill (40%), IQ (30%), Attitude (20%), Coachability (10%)[141][184]. Your video + headshot must show ALL 4, not just skill.

---

**Best Option: CANVA + Your Game Photo**

**Process:**

1. **Get action photos:**
   - Parent screenshots you from game footage
   - 5-10 different action photos (dribbling, defending, passing)

✅ All 3 uploaded to SportsRecruits profile
✅ SportsRecruits profile 100% COMPLETE

---

## **EXPERT ACTION STEP #3: MULTI-CHANNEL OUTREACH (WEDNESDAY - 2 HOURS)**

### **Why this step is CRITICAL:**

Single-channel = 5-10% response. Multi-channel = 287% higher engagement[167]. In 2025 with fewer roster spots and more portal transfers, coaches need to hear from you on MULTIPLE channels to break through the noise[170][176].

**Research shows it takes 15+ touchpoints across 5 channels to achieve 40%+ response[170]**

---

### **YOUR 5-CHANNEL STRATEGY:**

1. **Instagram DM** (90% open rate, coaches check constantly)
2. **Email** (formal, goes on record, many coaches still prefer)
3. **TikTok DM** (younger assistant coaches, emerging channel)
4. **Twitter/X DM** (some coaches active here)
5. **TEXT MESSAGE** (highest urgency, if you find personal number)

---

### **PART A: INSTAGRAM DM OUTREACH (45 MINUTES - Send to 15+ coaches)**

**Why Instagram first:** 90% open rate, coaches check DMs before email[119]

**Your strategy:** Send to 3 types at each school:
- Head Coach
- Assistant Coach (Recruiting Coordinator if available)
- Assistant Coach (Positional coach for YOUR position)

---

### **PSYCHOLOGY-BASED DM TEMPLATES (TOP 1% APPROACH)**

**Research shows:** AIDA + PAS + Reciprocity formulas = 35-45% response rate vs 2-3% generic[129][130]

---

### **DM TEMPLATE #1: "The Specific Research Angle"**
### (Primary target: Assistant Coaches - 40-50% response rate)[44]

**Copy/Paste and customize:**

```
Coach [Last Name],

I've been watching [School Name]'s system this season - the way you're 
pressing 80 yards and recovering aggressively is exactly how I defend.

Class of [Grad Year] [Position] from [Club Team]. Playing Surf Cup 
this weekend [Day] at [Time] on [Field] - Jersey #[X].

Quick facts:
- 3.8 GPA
- [Your best stat: 12 goals/8 assists/15 clean sheets]
- Playing time: [90 min/game starter]

Here's my film: [SportsRecruits link]

[Phone]
[Email]
```

**Why this works:**
- SPECIFIC to THEIR system (not generic)[129]
- Shows you researched THEM (not mass message)[130]
- Gives exact tournament details (low friction)[120]
- Leads with value (what you bring to them)[129]
- Targets assistant coaches (who respond 40-50%)[44]

---

### **DM TEMPLATE #2: "The Roster Needs Match"**
### (Target: Head Coaches - 15-20% response rate)

```
Coach [Last Name],

Saw on SportsRecruits you're recruiting [Position] for Class of [Grad Year].

I'm exactly that: [Grad Year] [Position], 3.8 GPA, [athletic stat].

Competing at Surf Cup this weekend [Day] [Time] Field [X]. Jersey #[X].

standing, a player from your area they recruited, their style, your shared 
major - something SPECIFIC, not generic praise]

- Proves you're a "potential match"[92]

---

### **DM TEMPLATE #3: "The Recruiting Coordinator"**
### (Target: Recruiting Coordinators - 50%+ response rate - HIGHEST)

```
[Coach Name],

Quick question: Are you the recruiting coordinator for [School] soccer?

If yes: I'm a [Grad Year] [Position] competing at Surf Cup this weekend 
[Time] Field [X]. Roster needs align perfectly.

**Why this works:**
- Direct question (easy to respond to)[120]
- Makes it personal (not mass message)[130]
- Creates urgency (specific tournament + time)[44]
- Recruiting coordinators are DEDICATED to this = highest response[170]

---

### **SENDING SEQUENCE (WEDNESDAY 6:00-7:00 PM)**

**Why 6-7 PM:** Coaches check DMs before bed, see messages first thing Thursday morning[169]

**Spread them out (don't mass message):**

- 6:00-6:15 PM: Send DMs to coaches 1-5 (wait 3 min between each)
- 6:20-6:35 PM: Send DMs to coaches 6-10
- 6:40-6:55 PM: Send DMs to coaches 11-15

**Why spacing matters:** Looks natural, not automated mass message[44]

---

### **PART B: EMAIL OUTREACH (60 MINUTES - 6:00-7:00 PM THURSDAY MORNING DELIVERY)**

**Why email matters (even in 2025):**
- Goes on official record[166]
- Many coaches STILL prefer email over DM[166]
- Professional tone signals maturity
- Easy to forward to other coaches
- Creates paper trail[35]

**Update your Instagram story:**

#SurfCup"

---

### **WHAT COACHES WILL EVALUATE (NOT JUST SKILL)**

**Coaches grade 4 things (in order of importance):[181][184]**

✅ **Coachability (30-35%):** Do you take feedback? Adjust quickly? Stay focused?
✅ **Work Ethic (25-30%):** Do you run when tired? Defend as hard as attack?
✅ **Body Language (20-25%):** Energy when not on ball? Supporting teammates?
✅ **Skill/Athleticism (15-20%):** Technical ability, speed, physicality

**How to show coachability at tournament:**
- Communicate constantly with teammates
- Encourage players after their mistakes
- Work hard even when losing
- Respect officials
- Show positive body language
- Take feedback gracefully

**What coaches DON'T want to see:**
- ❌ Hands on hips
- ❌ Head down after mistakes
- ❌ Eye-rolling when subbed
- ❌ Complaining to officials
- ❌ Negative body language

---

### **THURSDAY-FRIDAY: AFTER YOUR GAMES**

**Follow-up messages to coaches who:**
- Watched you
- Responded to your initial DM
- Made contact in person

**Follow-up template:**

```
Coach [Last Name],

Thank you for coming to watch / for responding to my message.

I hope I showed you my commitment to the game and why I'm interested 
in [School Name].

I'd love to continue the conversation about [School]. Are you available 
for a quick call next week?

[Your phone]
[Your email]

Looking forward to connecting,
[Your Name]
```

**Post on Instagram Stories:**
- Photo/video from your best game
- Caption: "Grateful for the opportunities this weekend. Tournament 
showed what we can do. 💪"

---

### **BY SATURDAY/SUNDAY:**

**Expected results:**
- 📱 3-8 coaches have responded to your initial outreach
- 📱 1-3 coaches watched you in person
- 📱 1-2 phone conversations scheduled for next week
- 📱 2-4 coaches requesting your schedule for future tournaments

---

---

## **HOW THIS BEATS WHAT 95% OF PLAYERS DO**

| Approach | Response | Why | 2025 Reality |
|----------|----------|-----|--------------|
| **95% of players** | Generic email to 50 random schools | Hope coach notices | 2-3% response, results in months |
| **Your system** | Targeted roster needs + 5-channel outreach to assistant coaches | Strategic, researched, persistent | 35-45% response, results in 48 hours |

**Key difference:** You're getting on STAGE 2 (Target List) not Stage 1 (Radar)[176]

## **FINAL EXPERT INSIGHT**
